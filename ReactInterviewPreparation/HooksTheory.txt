In React, hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components, which were originally stateless. Before hooks were introduced, state and lifecycle methods were only available in class components. Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 to enable developers to use state and other React features in functional components, making it easier to manage and share component logic.

State Management with useState:

One of the most common use cases for hooks is state management. The useState hook allows functional components to have state variables. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function that lets you update it.

Notice that we are destructuring useState from react as it is a named export.
